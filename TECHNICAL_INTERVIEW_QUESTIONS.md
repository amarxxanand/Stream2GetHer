## Interview Tips

### Preparation Strategy:
1. **Practice coding problems** on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank
2. **Understand fundamentals** deeply rather than memorizing
3. **Practice explaining concepts** out loud
4. **Review your projects** and be ready to discuss technical decisions
5. **Prepare questions** to ask the interviewer about the role/company

### During the Interview:
- **Think out loud** while solving problems
- **Ask clarifying questions** before jumping into solutions
- **Start with a simple approach** then optimize
- **Test your code** with examples
- **Admit when you don't know** something but show willingness to learn

### Common Mistake to Avoid:
- Don't memorize answers - understand the concepts
- Don't jump straight into coding - discuss the approach first
- Don't give up easily - show your problem-solving process
- Don't forget to consider edge cases
- Don't be afraid to ask for hints if stuck

---

**Good luck with your interview!** Remember, the goal is not just to know the answers but to demonstrate your problem-solving ability, communication skills, and eagerness to learn.
